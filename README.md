TITLE:
Air Insight: Real-time Air Quality Data with JSON API

This project is a web application built using the AirQuality API. I retrieved the API key from their website and developed the project with Node.js, Express, EJS, and Axios.

HOW IT WORKS:
- Users can submit country, state, and city details through a form on the website.
- The website fetches the air quality data and returns it in JSON format.
- The JSON data includes essential information such as latitude, longitude, location, and air quality metrics.
  
This interface simplifies the process of retrieving air quality information for a specific place without needing an API key, making it easier for users to access and utilize the data.
